# CNN-Fashion-MNIST

 I tried to implement a three layerd CNN with Batch Normalisation and MaxPooling.
 I got an Accuracy of 90.00 % after 5000 iterations. I added Batch normalisation after every later to accelerate the performance.

The Architecture is as follows-
Convolutional Layer 1 with output feature map 16 and 5*5 kernel ReLU Activation
MaxPooling 1
BatchNormalisation 1

Convolutional Layer 2 with output feature map 32  and 5*5 kernel ReLU Activation
MaxPooling 2
BatchNormalisation 2

Convolutional Layer 3 with output feature map 64 and 5*5 kernel ReLU Activation
MaxPooling 3
BatchNormalisation 3

Fully Connected Layer.
